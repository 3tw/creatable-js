# Create Element JS

Lightweight package for creating DOM elements with JavaScript using method chaining paradigm.

## Demo

How does it work? There is a [demo page](https://3tw.github.io/creatable-js-demo/) for you to check out. You will find a 'code log' that lets you inspect the code as you create your first element with creatable-js.

## Install from NPM

You can install package via npm and import it to your .js file.

```bash
npm install creatable-js
```

```js
import Creatable from 'creatable-js'
```
